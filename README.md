# Linotype

Welcome to the linotype monorepo

# Introduction

Linotype is a system of two modules allowing you to easily create a component-based website system with Directus and Nuxt.

The first module for Directus allows you to automatically install the necessary interface for website creation and aditional API endpoints for data fetching from the frontend.

The second plugin for Nuxt allows you to automatically create the structure of your site (route, seo, sitemap, robots, meta, etc.). And just focus on the visual integration of your components.
